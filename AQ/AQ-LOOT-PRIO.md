# AQ LOOT PRIO

*A lot of the loot have been taken into consideration after looking at several sources. For a deep and detailed guide, please watch [Skarm](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DvxhSY5vJm5U&ved=2ahUKEwix2vCI2ZvrAhWGjosKHfvkBxYQwqsBMAB6BAgGEAQ&usg=AOvVaw3RcnR5LjfepG8hMQVaOIS7). Other sources will be linked to in respective sections.*

*The document is not fully complete and will be updated continuously.*

## T2,5 PRIO:

*Disclaimer: Following priorities are not set in stone. Interpret it rather like a rule of thumb. It's also important to get accociated idols which are rare drops in AQ40. We rather give out the set piece to someone that have the idol available and ready for use because the set pieces drop every raid. Raid attendance and performance are also two factors that matter when T2,5 pieces are handed out.*


### HEAD:
#### Emperor Vek'lor (Paladin, Hunter, Rogue, Druid):
    Rogue > others
#### Emperor Vek'nilash (Warrior, Warlock, Mage, Priest):
    Warrior (tank) > Warlock > Mage (to those without Mish'undare) > Mage (to those with Mish'undare) > Warrior (dps) > other

### SHOULDER & BOOTS:
#### Viscidus & Princess Huhuran:
##### (Warrior, Hunter, Rogue, Priest): 
    Warrior (tank, if needed) shoulders > Warrior (dps) shoulders > Rogue shoulders > Warrior (tank, if needed) boots > Rogue boots (to those without Boots of Shadow Flame) > Rogue boots (to those with Boots of Shadow Flame) > Warrior (dps) boots > others
If tanks got DTP, they probably want to skip T2,5 shoulders for now. And for dps warrior boots: R12, Chromatic and Boots of the Fallen Hero are likely better. 

##### (Paladin, Mage, Warlock, Druid): 
    Warlock shoulders > Warlock boots = Mage shoulders+boots > others

### LEGS:
#### Ouro:
##### (Warrior, Rogue, Priest, Mage): 
    Warrior (tank) > Warrior (dps) > Rogue > Mage (AQ20 legs better) > Priest
##### (Paladin, Hunter, Warlock, Druid): 
    Feral > others
The worst T2,5 set piece. Warlocks get better legs in AQ20. Decent Feral legs though.

### CHEST:
#### C'Thun:
##### (Warrior, Paladin, Hunter, Rogue):
    Warrior (tank) > Rogue > Hunter > Warrior (dps) > others
For dps warriors, Breast of Annihilation is better than T2,5.

##### (Priest, Mage, Warlock, Druid):
    Warlock = Mage > others

#### Bad upgrades for following classes:
    Paladin (only for Ret)
    Priest (only for Shadow Priest)
    Hunter (except the chest piece)

---

### EYE OF C'THUN:
    Warrior (main tank) > Casters > Healers > Hunters > others

### IMPERIAL QIRAJI REGALIA:
    Feral > Warlock > Mage > Healer that needs it (not having Lok/C'Thun Mace) > Warrior (tank without TF) > others
If you as a caster/healer takes Regalia, you are kind of obligated to go for 2H weapons and not 1H weapons like the [Femur](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21622/sharpened-silithid-femur) or [C'Thun scepter](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21839/scepter-of-the-false-prophet). 

### IMPERIAL QIRAJI ARMAMENTS:
    Rogue (dagger) = Warrior (dps non-human with edgemaster) > others

| Cloak of Concentrated Hatred | Back        | The Prophet Skeram        | BIS P5*              | * Threat, if hit needed.
| Guise of the Devourer        | Head        | Bug trio, Vem killed last | BIS rest of the game |
| Vest of swift Execution      | Chest       | Bug trio, Kri killed last | Arguably BIS P5      |
| Gloves of Enforcement        | Hands       | Battleguard Sartura       | BIS rest of the game*| * Threat.
| Thick Qirajihide Belt        | Waist       | Battleguard Sartura       | BIS rest of the game*| * Mitigation.
| Hive Tunneler's Boots        | Feet        | Fankriss the Unyielding   | BIS rest of the game*| * Mitigation.
| Mantle of Wicked Revenge     | Shoulder    | Fankriss the Unyielding   | BIS rest of the game |

| Ring of the Godslayer        | Finger      | C'Thun                    |                      |
| Blessed Qiraji War Hammer    | 1H mace     | Imperial Qiraji Regalia   | Arguably BIS P5*     | * Threat. MCP active is still better but the passive stats on this is way better.

#### T2,5:
    No pure feral items. The legs are decent. The other pieces will probably be prioed to other (more needing) classes.

| Cloak of Concentrated Hatred          | Back      | The Prophet Skeram        |                      | Rather prio to rogues.

| Cloak of the Golden Hive              | Back      | Princess Huhuran          |                      | More defensive cape than Fallen God.
| Ring of Emperor Vek'lor               | Finger    | Emperor Vek'lor           | BIS rest of the game*| * Mitigation
| Royal Qiraji Belt                     | Waist     | Emperor Vek'lor           | BIS P5               |
| Qiraji Execution Bracers              | Wrist     | Emperor Vek'lor           | BIS P5*              | * BIS for threat if hit needed. Rather prio to rogues/feral.

| Blessed Qiraji War Hammer             | 1H mace   | Imperial Qiraji Regalia   | BIS P5*              | * If no TF. Regalia is probably highly contested though.
| Anubisath Warhammer                   | 1H mace   | Trash                     | BIS P5*              | * If maces.

#### T2,5: (need all, arguably threat BIS rest of the game except boots) 
    Head (more defensive than Helm of Endless Rage)
    Shoulders (if hit needed compared to Drake Talon Pauldrons)
    Chest (huge upgrade)
    Legs (more threat than T2)
    Boots (worse threat than Chrom boots but more defensive)
*The set bonus is not that great.*

| ----------------------------- |----------|---------------------------|-----------------------| ------------------------------|
| Breastplate of Annihilation   | Chest    | The Prophet Skeram        | BIS P5                |
| Cloak of Concentrated Hatred  | Back     | The Prophet Skeram        |                       | Get cloak from AQ20 instead. Prio to rogues.
| Triad Girdle                  | Waist    | Bug Trio                  |                       | If no Onslaught Girdle. Waist from AQ20 should Hunter's have prio on.
| Boots of the Fallen Hero      | Feet     | Bug Trio, Vem killed last |                       | If no Chromatic Boots.
| Gloves of Enforement          | Hands    | Battleguard Sartura       |                       | If no Gauntlets of Annihilation, rather prio to rogues.
| Scaled Sand Reaver Leggings   | Legs     | Fankriss the Unyielding   |                       | Great option to T2,5 legs. 
| Barbed Choker                 | Neck     | Fankriss the Unyielding   | BIS until KT drop (P6)|
| Ancient Qiraji Ripper         | 1H sword | Fankriss the Unyielding   | BIS P5*               | If no CTS, human.
| Mantle of Wicked Revenge      | Shoulder | Fankriss the Unyielding   |                       | Alternative to T2,5 shoulders. If no leather user (especially feral) wants it. 
| Ring of the Qiraji Fury       | Finger   | Viscidus                  | BIS P5                | Really close to QSR. Circle of Applied Force is a good alternative.
| Hive Defiler Wristguards      | Wrist    | Princess Huhuran          | BIS rest of the game  |
| Qiraji Execution Bracers      | Wrist    | Emperor Vek'lor           |                       | If no Hive Defiler Wristguards. Rather prio to rogues/feral.

| Larvae of the Great Worm      | Gun      | Ouro                      | BIS P5                |
| Gauntlets of Annihilation     | Hands    | C'Thun                    | BIS rest of the game  |
| Cloak of Fallen God           | Back     | C'Thun                    |                       | Pick cloak from AQ20 instead due to high competition on Eye of C'Thun.
| Anubisath Warhammer           | 1H mace  | Trash                     | BIS P5*               | * If maces, human
| Blessed Qiraji War Axe        | 1H axe   | Imperial Qiraji Armaments | BIS P5*               | * If non-human with edgemaster

#### T2,5: (shoulders and legs should be prioritized)
    Shoulders (no big upgrade for R13) are BIS rest of the game.
    Legs (noticeably better than R12) are BIS P5.
    Chest is second BIS (after Breastplate of Annihilation). There are better upgrades in Naxx.
    Boots (no hit) are worse than Chromatic Boots, Boots of the Fallen Hero and arguably R12.
    Head is similar to Helm of Endless Rage and R13. You rather want Lionheart Helmet. 
*The set bonus is not that good.*

| Cloak of Concentrated Hatred  | Back    | The Prophet Skeram        | BIS                  | Sims just as good as Cloak of the Fallen God.
| Gloves of Enforement          | Hands   | Battleguard Sartura       | BIS*                 | * Only if you have Death's String. Otherwise use ACLG.
| Huhuran's Stinger             | Bow     | Princess Huhuran          |                      | If no Hunter wants, Striker's mark is BIS.

| Death's String                | Dagger  | C'Thun                    | BIS rest of the game | Insane DPS increase (+~40 dps compared to weapons P3).
| Blessed Qiraji Pugio          | Dagger  | Imperial Qiraji Armaments | BIS                  | Not unique. Great DPS increase (+~15-20 dps compared to weapons P3). If unlucky with not getting Death's String, use two of these.

#### T2,5:
    All 5 pieces good for dagger rogue.
*The set bonus is better for sword compared to dagger rogues.*

### SWORD:

#### T2,5:
    All 5 pieces for sword rogues.
*Good set bonus. Better set bonus than for dagger rogues.*

## HUNTER:

| --------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------| ------------------------------|
| Barb of the Sand Reaver   | Polearm     | Fankriss the Unyielding   | BIS P5               | For Melee Weave.
| Silithid Claw             | Fist Weapon | Battleguard Sartura       | BIS P5               |
| Huhuran's Stinger         | Bow         | Princess Huhuran          |                      | Only if missing Chromaggus xbow.

| Cloak of Fallen God       | Back        | C'Thun                    | BIS rest of the game | Will probably not be that highly prioritized since Cloak of Shrouded Mists is still really good and Eye of C'Thun gives insane upgrades to other classes. 

#### T2,5: 
    Chest is the only good piece. Warrior (tanks) and Rogues might have prio on it though.
